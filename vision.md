I want to make an app that allows mapping of ancient civilization and archaeological sites. Users would upload images and information, documents and pin them on locations on Google maps or Google Earth or an open source platform like that. For example, right now, people are excavating new sites in eastern Turkey above and below water, and people are finding new things all the time. This would be a platform to catalog and pin interesting new discoveries all over Google Earth in an attempt to piece together the ancient civilization that existed globally before they were wiped out after the younger dryas period. A global effort to solve the mystery
